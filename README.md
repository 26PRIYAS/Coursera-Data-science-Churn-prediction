# Churn Prediction Project

## Overview
The **Churn Prediction Project** aims to analyze customer behavior and build a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will churn (i.e., stop using a service). Churn prediction is essential for businesses, especially in subscription-based industries, as retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to predict customer churn based on historical data. The dataset includes customer demographics, account information, service usage patterns, and other behavioral data points. The challenge is to create a model that can accurately classify whether a customer will churn, allowing the business to take proactive measures to retain them.

## Data
The dataset typically includes the following features:
- **Customer demographics**: Age, gender, location, etc.
- **Account details**: Subscription type, tenure, monthly charges, etc.
- **Service usage**: Number of calls, data usage, internet service type, etc.
- **Customer support interactions**: Number of complaints, service downtimes, etc.
- **Contract information**: Contract length, payment method, etc.

The target variable is whether or not the customer has churned, represented as a binary label (1 = churned, 0 = not churned).

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values
   - Convert categorical variables to numerical values using one-hot encoding
   - Scale numerical features using standardization or normalization if necessary

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze feature correlations with churn
   - Visualize patterns and trends (e.g., churn rates by age group or contract type)
   - Identify data imbalances (e.g., more non-churned than churned customers)

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create new features to improve model performance (e.g., total tenure per service, monthly charges divided by service level)

4. **Model Building**:
   - Use machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting
   - Perform cross-validation to ensure generalization to new data

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC
   - Handle class imbalance using techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or adjusting class weights

6. **Model Interpretation**:
   - Use feature importance techniques (e.g., SHAP values, LIME) to interpret the most significant features influencing churn prediction

## Outcome
The final deliverable is a machine learning model capable of predicting customer churn. This allows businesses to target at-risk customers with retention strategies (e.g., special offers, improved service) before they churn.

## Key Learnings
- The importance of feature selection and engineering in predicting customer behavior
- Experience with classification algorithms and handling imbalanced datasets
- Evaluating model performance and interpreting results for actionable insights
