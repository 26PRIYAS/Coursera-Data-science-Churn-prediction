# Coursera Data Science Projects

This repository contains various projects completed during the **Data Science Specialization** on Coursera. Each project showcases different aspects of data science, from data wrangling and visualization to statistical modeling and machine learning.

## Overview

The repository is organized by individual projects completed as part of the Coursera coursework. Each project folder includes:
- **Code files**: Scripts and notebooks used to process data, analyze patterns, and build models.
- **Data**: Cleaned datasets or sample datasets (if the original dataset is too large).
- **Reports**: Detailed analysis and reports summarizing the project outcomes.
- **Readme files**: Each project folder contains a README that describes the problem statement, methodology, and key findings.

## Skills Demonstrated

Through the projects in this repository, the following data science skills are demonstrated:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
